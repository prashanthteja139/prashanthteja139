👋 Hey there! I'm Prashanth Teja

🚀 **DevSecOps & Cloud Enthusiast | Former Amazon DevOps Engineer | Lifelong Learner**

### 🧭 About Me

I'm a tech-driven professional passionate about **DevSecOps, Cloud Infrastructure, and Automation**.  
After honing my analytical and problem-solving skills at Amazon, where I investigated complex risk and compliance issues, I transitioned into DevOps engineering to build scalable, secure, and automated systems.

I now focus on designing end-to-end CI/CD pipelines, implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform and Ansible, managing containerized environments with Docker, and enhancing cloud security practices across AWS.

My goal is simple — **automate efficiently, deploy securely, and scale confidently**.
